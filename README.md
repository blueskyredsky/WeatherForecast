# ‚òÄÔ∏è Weather Forecast

This is a modern, modular weather application built for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and is designed to provide users with real-time weather data and forecasts. The application is structured into a core module for shared functionalities and a feature module for specific user-facing screens, allowing for a clean and scalable codebase.

## üìã Features

- **Current Weather**: This feature provides a comprehensive view of the current weather and a 24-hour hourly forecast. It includes:
    - **Automatic Location Detection**: The app requests the user's current location to display weather data for their immediate surroundings.
    - **Search Functionality**: Users can search for any location worldwide to get detailed weather information and forecasts.
- **Forecast**: This feature expands on the hourly forecast by providing more detailed, long-term weather predictions for a selected location.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project is built on the MVVM architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns.

-   **View**: Composable functions that observe changes in the ViewModel and update the UI accordingly.
-   **ViewModel**: Manages the UI state, handles user actions, and interacts with the Repository layer.
-   **Model**: Represents the data structures used throughout the application, including network responses.

## üß© Modules

The project is organized into the following modules to promote reusability and maintainability:

-   `app`: The main application module.
-   `core`: Contains common and reusable components.
    -   `common`: General utility classes and UI components.
    -   `location`: Handles all location-related logic, including requesting permissions and fetching coordinates.
    -   `network`: Manages API calls and data fetching from the weather service.
    -   `threading`: Provides components for managing coroutines and background operations.
-   `feature`: Contains the distinct feature modules.
    -   `currentweather`: Implements the current weather and search functionality.
    -   `forecast`: Implements the detailed weather forecast screen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Libraries

The application leverages a modern Android development stack:

-   **Language**: Kotlin
-   **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose for a declarative UI.
-   **Asynchronous Operations**: Kotlin Coroutines for managing background tasks.
-   **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for a clean and scalable DI setup.
-   **Networking**:
    -   Retrofit for type-safe HTTP client.
    -   OkHttp for efficient network requests.
    -   Kotlinx Serialization for JSON serialization/deserialization.
-   **Location Services**: Google Play Services Location for accurate location data.
-   **Image Loading**: Coil for image loading and caching.
-   **Permissions**: Accompanist Permissions to handle runtime permissions gracefully.
-   **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation for app navigation.
